# Skin Lesion Classification Project

This project aims to evaluate the impact of segmentation on the binary classification of skin lesions as either benign or malignant. By integrating segmentation techniques, we seek to determine their influence on the accuracy and reliability of the classification model. The methodology involves preprocessing the dataset, applying segmentation, extracting features, training the model, and comparing performance metrics with and without segmentation. Our goal is to enhance diagnostic accuracy in dermatology through improved classification methods. The repository includes scripts for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, and welcomes contributions for further improvement.
